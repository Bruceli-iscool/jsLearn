            Let's start learning Javascript! Chapter One
        </p>
        <p>
            1. The console.log() Function:
            You can use console.log() to print something in the terminal.
            For example, "console.log(4)" prints 4. Also, using single quotes(''), you can print strings! Without ' marks, you can only print integers and/or varibles.
        </p>
        <p> 2. Easy Varibles:
            You can assign a varible that it's value can't change by using "var x = 5", to break it down, x is the varible name and 5 is the value.
            If you want a varible that's value can change, use "let y = 2", to break it down, y is the varible name and 2 is the value. To assign a string to a varible, use "var f = 'John', in the code, ' mark does the same thing it does in the console.log('') from lesson one.
        </p>
        <p> 3. Easy Math Functions:
            The List: "Math.abs() returns the absoulute value of a varible, Math.floor() rounds up a varible, Math.random() chooses a random number between 0 and 1." To do math, + is addition, - is subtraction, * is multipulcation, / for division. Using Math.random() for a bigger range, for example 0 to 50, you would multiply 50 to Math.random() like this "Math.random()*50". A line of code using Math functions might 
            look like this "var x = Math.Random()*15".

        <p> 4. prompt(): How do you ask for input? Use the prompt() function! It's very simple, for example "var x = prompt('John/'s last name is')", the () part is for inserting a question (OR whatever you want to display.) with qoutes or a integer without qoutes. Now armed with this knowledge, how do we add user input to our subtraction calculator project?
